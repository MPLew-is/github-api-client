# GitHub GraphQL Client #

This package provides a GitHub GraphQL API client, automatically handling [the process for authenticating as a GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps#authenticating-as-a-github-app).

This is still in **extremely early development** and does not yet provide the full set of planned features.

See [the GitHub Actions Webhook example](./Examples/GithubActionsWebhookClient) for an example implementation runnable from the command line that invokes an Actions webhook on a configured repository as a GitHub App.
